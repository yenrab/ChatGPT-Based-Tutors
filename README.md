# ChatGPT-Based-Tutors
This is a repository for Scripts that can be put into an empty prompt of a new ChatGPT chat that turns the chat into a tutor on some given topic.

Some of these examples show how to include a tutor-lead review before diving in to new content.

Others show how to indicate primary and secondary sources of information to be used by the tutor without ignoring all other content on the topic.

Interested in participating? Want to change the world of education? 

This may be your chance. :slightly_smiling_face:
